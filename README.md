## User Story

As a web developer, I create web applications that are user friendly, follow best practices, and are accessible.  Each application should be writting in such a way that future changes are easy to do. 

## Instructions
Once on the webpage, the user can start typing text which will automatically be retrievalbe through the IndexedDB. When the user comes back at a later time, they will find the text has been retrieved from the IndexedDB.  

## Usage Video
An example of how it works can be viewed here:

## License
